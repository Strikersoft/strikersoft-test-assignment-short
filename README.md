# Getting started

- Fork repository
- Clone it locally
- Run `yarn` (ensure you have yarn (1.11+) and nodejs (12+) installed)
- Run `yarn test`

You will see, that tests are failed, since you need to implement functions in `1.maxChar.js`, `2.arrayToTree.js` and `3.isPalindrome.js`.
If you will implement those funcitions described above correctly, all tests should PASS.

When you feel that you are done (1 hour todo this task, approx), push changes to your repo and create pull request (or link to your repo).

So, what you need todo:

- Implement functions
- Verify that tests are passed
- Send link to your implementations to HR
